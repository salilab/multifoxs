<p>
MultiFoXS is a method for multi-state modeling with SAXS profiles.
The method was developed for interpretation of data collected for heterogeneous samples. Many proteins are conformationally heterogeneous in solution. We describe this heterogeneity using <b> multi-state models. </b> A multi-state model is a model that specifies two or more co-existing structural states and values for any other parameter, such as population weights.
<p>
The input to MultiFoXS is a protein structure and a SAXS profile. The output is a list of multi-state models that fit best to the input SAXS profile.

The MultiFoXS sever protocol involves three steps:

<ol>
<li> Conformational sampling. In this step we use Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) search [1,2] to sample the conformational space that is accessible to the input protein. It is recommended to generate ~10,000 conformations.

<li> SAXS scoring. The SAXS profile is calculate for each conformation using FoXS method [3,4].

<li> Multi-state model enumeration. Given ~10,000 input conformations and their computed SAXS profiles, multi-state
model enumeration is performed iteratively by branch-and-bound method [5].

</ol>
